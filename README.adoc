Executes a program and converts IP to Unix domain sockets at runtime via
{LD_PRELOAD} based on a list of rules, either given via short command line
options (see {rulespec}) or via a file containing a list of rules separated via
newline. The first matching rule causes *ip2unix* to replace the current IP
socket with a Unix domain socket based on the options given. For example if a
<<rule-socket-path,*path*>> is specified, the Unix domain socket will bind or
listen to the file given.

== Problem statement

A lot of programs are designed to only work with IP sockets, however very few
of them allow to communicate via Unix domain sockets. Unix domain sockets
usually are just files, so standard Unix file permissions apply to them.

IP sockets also have the disadvantage that other programs on the same host are
able to connect to them, unless you use complicated netfilter rules or network
namespaces.

So if you either have a multi-user system or just want to separate privileges,
Unix domain sockets are a good way to achieve that.

Another very common use case in nowadays systems is when you're using systemd
and want to use socket units for services that don't support socket activation.
Apart from getting rid of the necessity to specify explicit dependencies, this
is also very useful for privilege separation, since a lot of services can be
run in a separate network namespace.

The systemd use case is also useful even when not using Unix domain sockets in
socket units, since it allows to add IP-based socket activation to services
that don't support it.

[discrete]
== Short example

Let's say you have a small HTTP server you want to make available behind a HTTP
reverse proxy.

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ip2unix -r path=/run/my-http-server.socket my-http-server
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This will simply convert all IP sockets to the Unix domain socket available at
`/run/my-http-server.socket`. If you use a web server like
https://nginx.org/[nginx], you can use the following directive to connect to
that socket:

[source,nginx]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
proxy_pass http://unix:/run/my-http-server.socket;
---------------------------------------------------------------------

More examples can be found further below in section <<examples,Examples>>.

A short summary of all the options is available via `ip2unix --help` or
`man ip2unix` if you want to see all the details and options available.

== Build from source

=== Requirements

* https://mesonbuild.com/[Meson], at least version 0.46.0.
* https://ninja-build.org/[Ninja], at least version 1.5.
* {cpp} compiler supporting {cpp}17 (https://gcc.gnu.org/[GNU G++] version 7.0
  onwards).
* https://www.python.org/[Python] 3, at least version 3.6 is needed for running
  the integration tests.

.Optional dependencies:
* http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] or https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] for
  generating the manpage. The former is recommended as it generates a better
  manpage and also provides validation.
* https://pytest.org/[pytest] for running automated tests.
* {sysdman_url}/systemd-socket-activate.html[systemd-socket-activate]
  helper to run test cases specific to systemd socket activation support.

=== Cloning the repository

The source code can be fetched via https://git-scm.com/[Git] using the
following command:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone https://github.com/nixcloud/ip2unix.git
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You will get an `ip2unix` directory inside your current working directory. All
of the following steps are to be performed inside this `ip2unix` directory.

==== Using the Nix package manager

This is the easiest and recommended way to compile it from source and it should
work on any distribution.

If you are not running https://nixos.org/[NixOS] you can install
https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix] via the following command:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build *ip2unix* issue the following command from the top of the
source tree:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ nix-build
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This takes care of fetching the dependencies, building and running the test
suite. The resulting command can now be found in `result/bin/ip2unix`.

If you want to add the package to your user environment, you can install it
using the command:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ nix-env -f . -i
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Debian and derivatives

To install the required dependencies:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt install meson g++
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to have the manpage:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt install asciidoctor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you want to run the test suite, pytest is required:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt install python3-pytest
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== RPM-based distributions

To install the required dependencies:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo yum install meson gcc-c++
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to have the manpage:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo yum install asciidoctor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to run the test suite:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo yum install python3-pytest
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Arch Linux and derivatives

To install the required dependencies:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo pacman -S meson gcc
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to have the manpage:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo pacman -S asciidoctor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you want to run the test suite:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo pacman -S python-pytest
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Building

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ meson build
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to specify a different compiler executable, eg. `g++-7`:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ CXX=g++-7 meson build
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ninja -C build
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The executable is then placed in `build/ip2unix`, so to show the usage:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ build/ip2unix --help
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Installation

To install *ip2unix*, run the following command:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ninja -C build install
---------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, this will install *ip2unix* in `/usr/local/bin/ip2unix`.

=== Running tests

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ninja -C build test
---------------------------------------------------------------------

== Options

*-c, --check*::
  This is to validate whether the given rules are correct and the program
  just prints all validation errors to stderr and exits with exit code `0`
  if validation was successful and `1` if not.

*-h, --help*::
  Show command line usage and exit.

*--version*::
  Show version information and exit.

*-p, --print*::
  Print out the rules that are in effect in a tabular format. If you do not
  want to run the 'PROGRAM', you can use the *-c* option to exit after
  printing the rules.

*-r, --rule*='RULE'::
  A single rule for one particular socket to match. Can be specified multiple
  times to add more rules.

*-f, --file*='FILE'::
  Read rules from 'FILE', which contains a newline-separated list of rules as
  specified via `-r`. Empty lines as well as lines starting with `#` are
  skipped. Whitespace characters at the beginning of each line are stripped as
  well.

*-v, --verbose*::
  Increases the level of verbosity, according to the following table:

  'FATAL' (default);;
    Only prints fatal errors that causes the program to terminate.
  'ERROR' (*-v*);;
    Also print errors that are recoverable.
  'WARNING' (*-vv*);;
    Also print messages that might indicate possible problems.
  'INFO' (*-vvv*);;
    Also print informational messages about *ip2unix* behavior.
  'DEBUG' (*-vvvv*);;
    Also show messages about *ip2unix* internals along with source information.
  'TRACE' (*-vvvvv*);;
    Print every log message possible.

endif::[]

== Rule specification

Arguments specified via *-r* contain a comma-separated list of either flags or
options. If a value contains a comma (`,`), it has to be escaped using a
backslash (`\`) character. If you want to have a verbatim backslash character
just use two consecutive backslashes instead.

The following flags are available:

*in* | *out*::
Whether this rule applies to a server-side socket (`in`), a client-side
socket (`out`) or both if neither `in` nor `out` is specified.

*tcp* | *udp*::
Specifies the IP type, which currently is either `tcp` for TCP sockets, `udp`
for UDP sockets or if it is not defined it matches both UDP and TCP sockets.

ifndef::without-systemd[]
*systemd*[='FD_NAME']::
Use the socket passed along via file descriptor by systemd instead of
creating one.
+
An optional file descriptor name ('FD_NAME') can be specified to
distinguish between several socket units. This corresponds to the {fdname}
systemd socket option.
endif::[]

*reject*[='ERRNO']::
Reject calls to *connect* and *bind* with `EACCES` by default or the 'ERRNO'
specified either via name or as an integer.

*blackhole*::
When binding the socket, use a temporary file system path and *unlink* it
shortly after the *bind*. This is a way to deactivate a specific socket
without the application noticing.

*ignore*::
Prevents a socket from being converted to a Unix domain socket if this is
set. This is useful to exempt specific sockets from being matched when
another rule matches a broad scope.

These options are available:

*addr*[*ess*]='ADDRESS'::
The IP address to match, which can be either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

*port*='PORT'[-'PORT_END']::
UDP or TCP port number which for outgoing connections specifies the target
port and for incomping connections the port that the socket is bound to.
+
If a range is specified by separating two port numbers via `-`, the given
range is matched instead of just a single port. The range is inclusive, so if
`2000-3000` is specified, both port 2000 and port 3000 are matched as well.

[[rule-socket-path]]*path*='SOCKET_PATH'::
The path to the socket file to either bind or connect to.
+
Placeholders are allowed here and are substituted accordingly:
+
[horizontal]
*%p*;; port number
*%a*;; IP address or `unknown`
*%t*;; socket type (`tcp`, `udp` or `unknown`)
*%%*;; verbatim `%`

== Examples

=== Simple HTTP client/server

The following command spawns a small test web server listening on
`/tmp/test.socket`:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ip2unix -r in,path=/tmp/test.socket python3 -m http.server 8000
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This connects to the above test server listening on `/tmp/test.socket` and
should show a directory listing:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ip2unix -r out,path=/tmp/test.socket curl http://1.2.3.4/
---------------------------------------------------------------------

=== More complicated example

For example the following could be put into a file given by the *-f* command
line argument:

--------------------------------------------
out,port=53,ignore
out,tcp,path=/run/some.socket
in,addr=1.2.3.4,path=/run/another.socket
in,port=80,address=abcd::1,blackhole
in,port=80,reject=EADDRINUSE
ifndef::without-systemd[]
in,tcp,port=22,systemd=ssh
endif::without-systemd[]
--------------------------------------------

Each line corresponds to a single rule, that is processed in order of
appearance and the above example would result in the following:

. All outgoing connections to port 53 (no matter if it's TCP or UDP) will not
  be converted into Unix domain sockets.
. This rule will redirect all TCP connections except to port 53 (see above) to
  use the Unix domain socket at `/run/some.socket`.
. Matches the socket that listens to any port on the IPv4 address `1.2.3.4` and
  instead binds it to the Unix domain socket at `/run/another.socket`.
. The application may bind to the IPv6 address `abcd::1` on port 80 but it will
  not receive any connections, because no socket path exists.
. Trying to bind to port 80 on addresses other than `abcd::1` will result in an
  `EADDRINUSE` error.
ifndef::without-systemd[]
. Will prevent the TCP socket that would listen on port 22 to not listen at all
  and instead use the systemd-provided file descriptor named `ssh` for
  operations like {syscall_accept}.
endif::[]

The same can be achieved solely using *-r* commandline arguments:

[source,sh-session]
[subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ip2unix -r out,port=53,ignore \
          -r out,tcp,path=/run/some.socket \
          -r in,addr=1.2.3.4,path=/run/another.socket \
          -r in,port=80,address=abcd::1,blackhole \
          -r in,port=80,reject=EADDRINUSE {systemd_backslash}
ifndef::without-systemd[]
          -r in,tcp,port=22,systemd=ssh
endif::without-systemd[]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Limitations

* The program uses {LD_PRELOAD}, so it will only work with programs that are
dynamically linked against the C library. Using ip2unix on statically linked
executables or on executables that don't use the socket family functions of the
C library (like Go programs) will not work at the moment.

* If a client which is already using Unix *datagram* sockets sends packets via
*sendto* or *sendmsg* to a socket provided by *ip2unix* without binding first,
*ip2unix* is not able to identify the peer and will subsequently reject the
packet. This is not the case when using *ip2unix* itself on the the client side
and it also does not seem to be very common as the author so far did not find
such an application in the wild.
+
However, if this really is an issue to you, the recommended workaround is
either to use *ip2unix* to wrap the client (if it supports IP sockets) or fix
the server to natively use Unix domain sockets.

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== Isn't this functionality already covered by {socat}?

The {socat} tool has a very different purpose: It is essentially a way of
connecting streams between different address types. Apart from a myriad of
options, it supports quite a lot of address types and it's really good at
providing great flexibility to connect bidirectional streams.

However what it doesn't do is change the behaviour of the target application,
which is what *ip2unix* does.

For example, if you have an application that listens to TCP port 1234, you can
use {socat} to create a Unix domain socket listening on `foo.sock` and proxying
all requests to TCP port 1234:

[source,sh-session]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ socat UNIX-LISTEN:foo.sock,fork TCP:localhost:1234
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, the application will still listen to TCP port 1234, but we now have two
additional sockets (Unix inbound and TCP/IP outbound) we need to take care of.

*ip2unix* on the other side redirects the C library calls of the application in
question, so that TCP port 1234 will not be bound in the first place and
instead the application directly binds to a Unix domain socket.

This not only allows for better privilege separation (because local users need
file system access permissions to the socket file) but also involves less
overhead since only one socket (the listening socket of the application itself)
is used.

=== Yes, but can't this still be done via {socat} and the {xt_owner}?

Of course you could use *iptables* to only allow access to the user running
socat. But again, this still needs additional sockets and also still doesn't
decrease the attack surface by a large margin (eg. there could be race
conditions in loading *iptables* rules or simply human error specifying the
rules).

Not binding to an IP socket in the first place however gets rid of that attack
surface, since you can't attack things that don't exist.

== Similar projects

https://cwrap.org/socket_wrapper.html[socket_wrapper]::

The goal is a different one here and its main use is testing. Instead of
using rules, *socket_wrapper* turns *all* of the IP sockets into Unix sockets
and uses a central directory to do the mapping.
+
Containing all Unix sockets into one directory has the nice effect that it is
easy to map *any* address/port combination to Unix sockets. While this is way
easier to implement than our approach it has the drawback that everything is
contained and no IP communication is possible anymore.
